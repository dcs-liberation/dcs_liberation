* Raise awareness about the project, by making a video and/or a tutorial.

Should you report a bug, please use the search bar at the top of the page to see if it has already been reported.

## Making content for Liberation

You can create new campaigns : See [campaign creation wiki](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/wiki/Custom-Campaigns).
You can also improve existing campaigns.

You can then submit new campaigns on the "campaigns" channel on Discord, or by making a pull request if you are comfortable with git. 

## Develop new features

If you want to develop a new feature, we recommend you first open an issue describing the new feature and discuss it with us on Discord before starting development.
However, feel free to work on any existing issue.

## Pull requests

Please submit your pull requests on the **develop** branch. We expect a description of its content, and when applicable, a reference to the issue(s) it is resolving.
