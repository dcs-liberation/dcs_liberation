  \ NATO reporting name: Flogger) is a variable-geometry fighter aircraft, designed\
  \ by the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau in the Soviet Union. It is a third-generation\
  \ jet fighter, the world's most-produced variable-geometry aircraft, along with\
  \ similar Soviet aircraft such as the Su-17 'Fitter'. It was the first Soviet fighter\
  \ to field a look-down/shoot-down radar, the RP-23 Sapfir, and one of the first\
  \ to be armed with beyond-visual-range missiles. Production started in 1969 and\
  \ reached large numbers with over 5,000 aircraft built, making it the most produced\
  \ variable-sweep wing aircraft in history. Today the MiG-23 remains in limited service\
  \ with some export customers."
