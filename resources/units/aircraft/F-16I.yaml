description:
  "The F-16I is a two-seat variant of the Block 52 developed for the Israeli
  Defense Force – Air Force (IDF/AF). Israel issued a requirement in
  September 1997 and selected the F-16 in preference to the F-15I in July 1999.
  An initial "Peace Marble V" contract was signed on 14 January 2000 with a
  follow-on contract signed on 19 December 2001, for a total procurement of
  102 aircraft. The F-16I, which is called Sufa (Storm) by the IDF/AF, first
  flew on 23 December 2003, and deliveries to the IDF/AF began on 19
  February 2004."
