  "The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 is widely regarded as Germany's best fighter aircraft\
  \ of World War II. Its appearance in the skies over France in August 1941 was a\
  \ rude shock to the Allies, as it was clearly superior to any other plane. For nearly\
  \ a year, the Fw 190 was the unmatched champion of the air war in Europe. The Fw\
  \ 190 had speed and high altitude performance as its two great assets.\n\nThe development\
  \ of advanced allied fighters resulted in the Fw 190 D\u20139 variant which first\
  \ saw service in September 1944. This variant had a larger nose that housed a more\
  \ powerful Junkers Jumo engine that produced 2,100 hp with the MW-50 boost system.\
  \ The D-9 was designed for high altitude aerial combat and is a worthy adversary\
  \ to the P-51D Mustang."
