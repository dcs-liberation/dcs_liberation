description:
  "The F/A-18F Super Hornet is a tandem-seat, twin engine, carrier-capable, multirole
  fighter aircraft. The Super Hornets are larger and more advanced derivatives of the
  McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C and D Hornets, also known as legacy Hornets.


  The Super Hornet is equipped with a large suite of sensors that includes a radar, targeting
  pod, and a helmet mounted sight. In addition to its internal 20mm cannon, the Super Hornet
  can be armed with a large assortment of unguided bombs and rockets, laser and GPS-guided
  bombs, air-to-surface missiles of all sorts, and both radar and infrared-guided
  air-to-air missiles.


  The Super Hornet is also known for its extreme, slow-speed maneuverability in a dogfight.
  Although incredibly deadly, the Super Hornet is also a very easy aircraft to fly."
