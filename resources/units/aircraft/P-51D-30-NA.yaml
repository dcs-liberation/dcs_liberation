  The North American Aviation P-51 Mustang is an American long-range, single-seat
  fighter and fighter-bomber used during World War II and the Korean War, among other
  conflicts. From late 1943, P-51Bs and P-51Cs (supplemented by P-51Ds from mid-1944)
  were used by the USAAF's Eighth Air Force to escort bombers in raids over Germany,
  while the RAF's Second Tactical Air Force and the USAAF's Ninth Air Force used the
  Merlin-powered Mustangs as fighter-bombers, roles in which the Mustang helped ensure
  Allied air superiority in 1944. The P-51 was also used by Allied air forces in the
  North African, Mediterranean, Italian, and Pacific theaters. During World War II,
  Mustang pilots claimed to have destroyed 4,950 enemy aircraft. At the start of the
  Korean War, the Mustang, by then redesignated F-51, was the main fighter of the
  United States until jet fighters, including North American's F-86, took over this
  role; the Mustang then became a specialized fighter-bomber. Despite the advent of
  jet fighters, the Mustang remained in service with some air forces until the early
  1980s. After the Korean War, Mustangs became popular civilian warbirds and air racing
  aircraft.
