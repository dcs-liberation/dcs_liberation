  "The Sukhoi Su-34 (Russian: \u0421\u0443\u0445\u043E\u0439 \u0421\u0443\
  -34; NATO reporting name: Fullback) is a Soviet-origin Russian twin-engine, twin-seat,\
  \ all-weather supersonic medium-range fighter-bomber/strike aircraft. It first flew\
  \ in 1990, intended for the Soviet Air Forces, and it entered service in 2014 with\
  \ the Russian Air Force. Based on the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker air superiority fighter,\
  \ the Su-34 has an armored cockpit for side-by-side seating of its two-person crew.\
  \ The Su-34 is designed primarily for tactical deployment against ground and naval\
  \ targets (tactical bombing/attack/interdiction roles, including against small and\
  \ mobile targets) on solo and group missions in daytime and at night, under favourable\
  \ and adverse weather conditions and in a hostile environment with counter-fire\
  \ and electronic Warfare (EW) counter-measures deployed, as well as for aerial reconnaissance.\
  \ The Su-34 will eventually replace the Su-24 tactical strike fighter and the Tu-22M3\
  \ long-distance bomber."
