description:
  'The EA-18G Growler is twin engine, supersonic Electronic Warfare Aircraft that is flown
  by a pilot and a WSO (Weapon Systems Officer) in a "glass cockpit". It combines extreme maneuverability , a
  deadly arsenal of weapons, and the ability to operate from an aircraft carrier.
  Operated by several nations, this multi-role fighter has been instrumental in conflicts
  from 2009 to today.
  
  The flight capabilities of the Growler closely mirror those of the F/A-18E/F. 
  This characteristic allows the Growler to excel in both escort jamming and the conventional standoff jamming mission,
  which involves radar jamming and deception. Growlers can seamlessly accompany F/A-18s throughout
  all stages of an attack mission. To enhance the Growler's stability during electronic warfare operations, 
  Boeing made modifications to the leading edge fairings and wing fold hinge fairings, incorporating wing fences and
  aileron "tripper strips".'

    # DCS will clobber channel 1 of the first radio compatible with the flight's
    # assigned frequency. Since the EA-18's two radios are both AN/ARC-210s,
    # radio 1 will be compatible regardless of which frequency is assigned, so
    # we must use radio 1 for the intra-flight radio.
