description:
  "The AJS-37 Viggen is a Swedish double-delta supersonic attack aircraft\
  \ from the late Cold War. It was the backbone of the Swedish Air Force during the\
  \ Cold war, serving as the main attack and anti-ship platform. The AJS is the 90\u2019\
  s upgrade of this 70's era aircraft, adding several advanced weapons and systems\
  \ functionalities. The aircraft was designed around the pilot, with an excellent\
  \ man-machine interface, supporting the pilot through the smart use of autopilot\
  \ systems, radar and HUD symbology in order to deliver the ordnance onto targets\
  \ from treetop level with high speed attack runs.\n\nThe aircraft is armed with\
  \ multiple weapon systems ranging from programmable stand-off weapons such as the\
  \ RB-15F antiship missile to the BK90 Cluster munitions dispenser to various bombs,\
  \ rockets and missiles for a wide range of target types. The aircraft can also carry\
  \ gun pods and the Sidewinder series of infrared-guided missiles for air defence\
  \ and self-protection purposes."
