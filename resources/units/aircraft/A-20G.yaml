description: The Douglas A-20 Havoc (company designation DB-7) is an American medium
  bomber, attack aircraft, night intruder, night fighter, and reconnaissance aircraft
  of World War II. Designed to meet an Army Air Corps requirement for a bomber, it
  was ordered by France for their air force before the USAAC decided it would also
  meet their requirements. French DB-7s were the first to see combat; after the fall
  of France the bomber, under the service name Boston continued with the Royal Air
  Force. From 1941, night fighter and intruder versions were given the service name
  Havoc. In 1942 USAAF A-20s saw combat in North Africa.
