description: The B-17 was primarily employed by the USAAF in the daylight strategic
  bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial, military and civilian
  targets. The United States Eighth Air Force, based at many airfields in central,
  eastern and southern England, and the Fifteenth Air Force, based in Italy, complemented
  the RAF Bomber Command's night-time area bombing in the Combined Bomber Offensive
  to help secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western
  Europe in preparation for the invasion of France in 1944.it was a relatively fast,
  high-flying, long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload.
  It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged
  B-17s safely returning to base. The B-17 dropped more bombs than any other U.S.
  aircraft in World War II. Of approximately 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped on
  Nazi Germany and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft, over 640,000 tons were
  dropped from B-17s.
