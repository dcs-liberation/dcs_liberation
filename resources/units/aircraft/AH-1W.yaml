description: The AH-1 Cobra was developed in the mid-1960s as an interim gunship for
  the U.S. Army for use during the Vietnam War. The Cobra shared the proven transmission,
  rotor system, and the T53 turboshaft engine of the UH-1 'Huey'. By June 1967, the
  first AH-1G HueyCobras had been delivered. Bell built 1,116 AH-1Gs for the U.S.
  Army between 1967 and 1973, and the Cobras chalked up over a million operational
  hours in Vietnam.
