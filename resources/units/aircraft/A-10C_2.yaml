radios:
  # DCS will clobber channel 1 of the AN/ARC-164 with the flight's assigned
  # frequency, so we may as well use that one for intra-flight.
  #
  # This ends up working out nicely anyway, because it's much easier on the
  # pilot to have the AN/ARC-210 be the inter-flight radio since that's the one
  # with HUD support and the control panel that makes switching channels easier.
