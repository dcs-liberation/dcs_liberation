radios:
  type: common
  # DCS will clobber channel 1 of the first radio compatible with the flight's
  # assigned frequency. Since the A-10C's first two radios are both AN/ARC-210s,
  # radio 1 will be compatible regardless of which frequency is assigned, so
  # we must use radio 1 for the intra-flight radio.
