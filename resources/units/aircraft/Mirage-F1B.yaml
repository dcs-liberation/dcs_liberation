description:  # From wikipedia
  The Dassault Mirage F1 is a French fighter and attack aircraft designed and manufactured
  by Dassault Aviation. It was developed as a successor to the popular Mirage III family.
  
  The French Air Force also ordered 20 Mirage F1Bs, a two-seat operational conversion trainer;
  these were delivered between October 1980 and March 1983.[108] The extra seat and controls added
  only 30 cm (12 in) to the length of the fuselage, but at the cost of less internal fuel capacity
  and the loss of the internal cannons.
