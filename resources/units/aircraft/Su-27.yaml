description:
  The Su-27, NATO codename Flanker, is one of the pillars of modern-day
  Russian combat aviation. Built to counter the American F-15 Eagle, the Flanker is
  a twin-engine, supersonic, highly manoeuvrable air superiority fighter. The Flanker
  is equally capable of engaging targets well beyond visual range as it is in a dogfight
  given its amazing slow speed and high angle attack manoeuvrability. Using its radar
  and stealthy infrared search and track system, the Flanker can employ a wide array
  of radar and infrared guided missiles. The Flanker also includes a helmet-mounted
  sight that allows you to simply look at a target to lock it up! In addition to its
  powerful air-to-air capabilities, the Flanker can also be armed with bombs and unguided
  rockets to fulfil a secondary ground attack role.
