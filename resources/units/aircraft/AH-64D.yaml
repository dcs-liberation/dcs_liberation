description: The legendary 'Apache' is an US twin-turboshaft attack helicopter for
  a crew of two. It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition and
  night vision systems. It is armed with a 30 mm (1.18 in) M230 chain gun carried
  between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four hardpoints
  mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture
  of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. The AH-64 has significant
  systems redundancy to improve combat survivability. American AH-64s have served
  in conflicts in Panama, the Persian Gulf, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Israel
  used the Apache in its military conflicts in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. British
  and Dutch Apaches have seen deployments in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
