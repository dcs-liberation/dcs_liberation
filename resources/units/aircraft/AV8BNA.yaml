description:
  'The AV-8B project was born in the early 1970''s as an effort to address
  the operational inadequacies of the AV-8A first generation Harrier, aimed to dramatically
  improve the capabilities and performance of the early AV-8A''s. The AV-8B made its
  maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the United States Marine
  Corps in January 1985. It later evolved into the AV-8B N/A (Night Attack) and AV-8B
  Harrier II Plus.


  First flight of a modified AV-8B in the night attack configuration was on June 26th,
  1987. Deliveries to the USMC began in September of 1989 to VMA-214 at Yuma, Arizona.
  Follow-up units based out of Yuma received their Night Attack AV-8Bs by the end
  of 1992.The AV-8B N/A variant (originally known as the AV-8D) had its first operational
  development in 1984 and included use of the NAVFLIR (Navigation Forward-Looking
  Infrared camera, consisting of a GEC-Marconi FLIR system mounted in the nose) for
  night operations. Additionally, GEC Cat''s Eyes night vision goggles were provided
  to the pilot as well as a revised cockpit with color MFDs, a wider field-of-view
  HUD display, a color CRT digital moving map, and a complete "heads-down" operation
  capability. The AV-8B N/A also sports four Tracor ALE-39 countermeasures dispensers
  along the top of the rear fuselage, in addition to two ALE-39 dispensers along the
  lower rear of the fuselage. The AV-8B N/A also fields an updated version of the
  Rolls-Royce Pegasus 11-61 (F402-RR-408) vectored-thrust turbofan engine.'
