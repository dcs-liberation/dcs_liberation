description: The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk is a semi-retired American single-seat,
  twin-engine stealth attack aircraft that was developed by Lockheed's secretive Skunk
  Works division and operated by the United States Air Force (USAF). It was the first
  operational aircraft to be designed around stealth technology. The F-117 was widely
  publicized for its role in the Persian Gulf War of 1991. Although it was commonly
  referred to as the 'Stealth Fighter', it was strictly a ground-attack aircraft.
  F-117s took part in the conflict in Yugoslavia, where one was shot down and another
  damaged by surface-to-air missiles (SAM) in 1999. The U.S. Air Force retired the
  F-117 in April 2008, primarily due to the fielding of the F-22 Raptor. Despite the
  type's retirement, a portion of the fleet has been kept in airworthy condition,
  and Nighthawks have been observed flying in 2020.
