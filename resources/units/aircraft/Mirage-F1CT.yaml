  The Dassault Mirage F1 is a French fighter and attack aircraft designed and manufactured
  by Dassault Aviation. It was developed as a successor to the popular Mirage III family.

  The Mirage F1CT is a ground attack version of the Mirage F1C-200.
  Following their replacement in the air defence role by the Mirage 2000,
  the French Air Force had a number of surplus Mirage F1C-200s, and in 1988 it launched a conversion
  programme to turn these aircraft into interim ground attack aircraft to replace elderly Mirage IIIEs
  and Mirage 5s. The Mirage F1CT program brought the avionics of the F1C up to the standard of the F1CR,
  with the radar upgraded with the additional air-to-ground modes of the Cyrano IVM-R,
  an improved navigation/attack system fitted, with a laser rangefinder fitted under the nose.
  It was fitted with new Mk 10 ejection seats, while improved radar detection and warning devices,
  chaff/flare dispensers, and secure radios were also added. It gained the ability to carry a variety
  of air-to-ground weapons, including rockets, cluster bombs and laser-guided bombs,
  while retaining the F1C's air-to-air armament.
