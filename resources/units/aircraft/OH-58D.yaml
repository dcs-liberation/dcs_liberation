description: The Bell OH-58 Kiowa is a family of single-engine, single-rotor, military
  helicopters used for observation, utility, and direct fire support. Bell Helicopter
  manufactured the OH-58 for the United States Army based on its Model 206A JetRanger
  helicopter. The OH-58 was in continuous U.S. Army service from 1969 to 2017, when
  it was replaced in these roles by the Boeing AH-64 Apache and Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota.
  The latest model, the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, is primarily operated in an armed reconnaissance
  role in support of ground troops. The OH-58 has been exported to Austria, Canada,
  Croatia, the Dominican Republic, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and Greece. It has also been
  produced under license in Australia.
