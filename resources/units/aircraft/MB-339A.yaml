  channels:
    # The common allocator is sufficient for Liberation's purposes. There are
    # more than 20 channels available on COMM2 (manual says 100, ME says 30,
    # presumably only 30 can be truly *pre* set, and the other 70 can be set in
    # the cockpit). We never need that many though, so no sense customizing
    # further.
    type: common
    # COMM1 us UHF only. COMM2 is V/UHF. We prefer allocating intra-flight on
    # VHF because it's less contested, so intra-flight goes to COMM2.
