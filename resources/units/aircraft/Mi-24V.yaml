description: "The Mil Mi-24 (Russian: \u041C\u0438\u043B\u044C \u041C\u0438-24; NATO\
  \ reporting name: Hind) is a large helicopter gunship, attack helicopter and low-capacity\
  \ troop transport with room for eight passengers. It is produced by Mil Moscow Helicopter\
  \ Plant and has been operated since 1972 by the Soviet Air Force and its successors,\
  \ along with 48 other nations. Soviet pilots called the Mi-24 the 'flying tank'\
  \ (Russian: \u043B\u0435\u0442\u0430\u044E\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0430\u043D\u043A\
  , romanized: letayushchiy tank), a term used historically with the famous World\
  \ War II Soviet Il-2 Shturmovik armored ground attack aircraft. More common unofficial\
  \ nicknames were 'Galina' (or 'Galya'), 'Crocodile' (Russian: \u041A\u0440\u043E\
  \u043A\u043E\u0434\u0438\u043B, romanized: Krokodil), due to the helicopter's camouflage\
  \ scheme, and 'Drinking Glass' (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043A\u0430\u043D, romanized:\
  \ Stakan), because of the flat glass plates that surround earlier Mi-24 variants'\
  \ cockpits. It served to a great success in the Afghanistan war, until the Taliban\
  \ where equiped with Stinger Misseles from the CIA."
