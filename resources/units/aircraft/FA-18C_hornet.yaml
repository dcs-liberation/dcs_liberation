description:
  'The F/A-18C Hornet is twin engine, supersonic fighter that is flown
  by a single pilot in a "glass cockpit". It combines extreme maneuverability , a
  deadly arsenal of weapons, and the ability to operate from an aircraft carrier.
  Operated by several nations, this multi-role fighter has been instrumental in conflicts
  from 1986 to today.


  The Hornet is equipped with a large suite of sensors that includes a radar, targeting
  pod, and a helmet mounted sight. In addition to its internal 20mm cannon, the Hornet
  can be armed with a large assortment of unguided bombs and rockets, laser and GPS-guided
  bombs, air-to-surface missiles of all sorts, and both radar and infrared-guided
  air-to-air missiles.


  The Hornet is also known for its extreme, slow-speed maneuverability in a dogfight.
  Although incredibly deadly, the Hornet is also a very easy aircraft to fly.'
