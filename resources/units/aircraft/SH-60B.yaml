description: The Sikorsky SH-60/MH-60 Seahawk (or Sea Hawk) is a twin turboshaft engine,
  multi-mission United States Navy helicopter based on the United States Army UH-60
  Black Hawk and a member of the Sikorsky S-70 family. The most significant modifications
  are the folding main rotor and a hinged tail to reduce its footprint aboard ships.
  The U.S. Navy uses the H-60 airframe under the model designations SH-60B, SH-60F,
  HH-60H, MH-60R, and MH-60S. Able to deploy aboard any air-capable frigate, destroyer,
  cruiser, fast combat support ship, amphibious assault ship, Littoral combat ship
  or aircraft carrier, the Seahawk can handle anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface
  warfare (ASUW), naval special warfare (NSW) insertion, search and rescue (SAR),
  combat search and rescue (CSAR), vertical replenishment (VERTREP), and medical evacuation
  (MEDEVAC).
