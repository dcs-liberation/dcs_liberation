description: The Junkers Ju 88 is a German World War II Luftwaffe twin-engined multirole
  combat aircraft. Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works (JFM) designed the plane in the
  mid-1930s as a so-called Schnellbomber ('fast bomber') that would be too fast for
  fighters of its era to intercept. It suffered from technical problems during its
  development and early operational periods but became one of the most versatile combat
  aircraft of the war. Like a number of other Luftwaffe bombers, it served as a bomber,
  dive bomber, night fighter, torpedo bomber, reconnaissance aircraft, heavy fighter
  and at the end of the war, as a flying bomb. Despite a protracted development, it
  became one of the Luftwaffe's most important aircraft. The assembly line ran constantly
  from 1936 to 1945 and more than 15,000 Ju 88s were built in dozens of variants,
  more than any other twin-engine German aircraft of the period. Throughout production
  the basic structure of the aircraft remained unchanged.
