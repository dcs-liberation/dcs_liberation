  The Sukhoi Su-17 (izdeliye S-32) is a variable-sweep wing fighter-bomber
  developed for the Soviet military. Its NATO reporting name is "Fitter". Developed
  from the Sukhoi Su-7, the Su-17 was the first variable-sweep wing aircraft to enter
  Soviet service. Two subsequent Sukhoi aircraft, the Su-20 and Su-22, have usually
  been regarded as variants of the Su-17. The Su-17 has had a long career and has
  been operated by many other air forces of including the Russian Federation, other
  former Soviet republics, the former Warsaw Pact, countries in the Arab world, Angola
  and Peru.
