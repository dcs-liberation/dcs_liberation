  "The Grumman F-14 Tomcat is a two-crew, variable wing-geometry, maritime\
  \ air superiority fighter that served with the US Navy for 32 years and continues\
  \ to serve with the IRIAF in Iran. The F-14 was the US Navy's frontline fighter\
  \ from the 1970s to the mid-2000s. Over the course of its long service it also became\
  \ one of the US Navy\u2019s premier precision ground-attack platform and its lone\
  \ airborne reconnaissance asset.\n\nNoteworthy features of the Tomcat are its swing-wing\
  \ configuration, two-man crew, and the powerful AN/AWG-9 Weapons Control System\
  \ (WCS) and radar. The AWG-9 allows employment of the long-range AIM-54 Phoenix\
  \ air-to-air missile, and the LANTIRN targeting pod allows precision ground strikes\
  \ using laser-guided bombs. The F-14 Tomcat was present in several historic events\
  \ that include the two Gulf of Sidra incidents, Operations Desert Storm Iraqi Freedom,\
  \ the Yugoslavian conflict, and Operation Enduring Freedom over Afghanistan. It\
  \ was also immortalized in the iconic motion picture, Top Gun, and starred in several\
  \ other feature films including The Final Countdown, Executive Decision, and others.\n\
  \nThe Tomcat was also played a vital role in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, where\
  \ is flew for the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force."
