description:
  'The Su-33 has been the backbone of Russian aircraft carrier aviation
  since the late 1990s and is an all-weather fighter capable of engaging both air
  and surface targets. Based on the powerful Su-27 "Flanker", the Su-33 is a navalized
  version suited for operations aboard the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier. Changes
  to the Su-33 include strengthened landing gear, folding wings, more powerful engines,
  and the very visible canards.


  The Su-33 is equipped with a powerful pulse doppler radar and an Infrared Search
  and Track (IRST) for engaging aerial targets with a wide range of radar- and infrared-guided
  missiles and its internal cannon. For air-to-surface attack, the Su-33 can be armed
  with many types of unguided bombs, rockets, and cluster munitions.


  Despite its large size, the Su-33 is very capable in a dogfight when combined with
  its integral helmet-mounted sight and off-boresight missiles.'
