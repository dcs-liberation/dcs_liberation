description:
  "JF-17 is a single seat, single engine, multirole light fighter that\
  \ was joint developed by AVIC Chengdu and Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC). The\
  \ design phase of JF-17 \"Thunder\" finished at May 31st, 2002, and the maiden flight\
  \ was made on August 25th, 2003. The first plane delivered to PAF (Pakistan Air\
  \ Force) in 2007. Currently several different blocks of JF-17s are in service in\
  \ Pakistan and Myanmar air forces. There are also several countries interested in\
  \ purchasing this fighter jet. On February 27th, 2019, \"Thunder\" has withstood\
  \ the test of actual combat and helped PAF win an appreciable victory.\n\n\"Thunder\"\
  \ is a type of fighter that specifically tailored for PAF. The development plan\
  \ of her predecessor can even be traced back to 1985. At first, PAF was only looking\
  \ for a fighter that can replace Shenyang J-6 (Chinese version of Mig-19), but they\
  \ were not satisfied with Chengdu\u2019s J-7M. After more than 20 years of development,\
  \ the final product \"Thunder\" becomes completely different from J-7M.\n\n\"Thunder\"\
  \ has a bubble canopy of great view, pretty strake-wing layout and advanced avionics.\
  \ KLJ-7 radar provides excellent air to ground capability. WMD-7 targeting pod can\
  \ help \"Thunder\" searching for targets in combat."
