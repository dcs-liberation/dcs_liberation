  "The MiG-19P Farmer was designed by the legendary Mikoyan Design Bureau\
  \ in the Early 1950\u2019s. The MiG-19 fighter was the Soviet Union\u2019s first\
  \ true supersonic Interceptor that could exceed Mach 1 in level flight.\n\nDesigned\
  \ to take on enemy fighters and bombers at any time of day or night and in any weather\
  \ condition, the Farmer was equipped with the RP-5 lzumrud radar in the nose and\
  \ armed with two NR-30 30mm cannons in the wing roots. The Farmer is also able to\
  \ carry an array of ground attack weapons that includes S-5M rockets and various\
  \ general-purpose bombs. It is a lethal interceptor with conventional ground attack\
  \ capabilities."
