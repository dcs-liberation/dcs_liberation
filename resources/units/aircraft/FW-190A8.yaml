description:
  "Designed for the German Luftwaffe by famed aircraft designer Kurt Tank
  in the late-1930s, the Fw 190 was the backbone of the Luftwaffe in both fighter
  and attack bomber roles. Powered by a large radial engine, the A version of the
  Focke-Wulf 190 was superior in many ways to the Bf 109s and Spitfires at the time
  of its introduction. In fact, this led to the development of the Mk.IX version of
  the Spitfire.


  Many of the Luftwaffe's aces racked up their impressive kill counts in the Fw 190
  A due to its impressive fire power, excellent low to medium altitude performance,
  durability, and ease of flying. It saw action on both the eastern and western fronts
  where it was both respected and feared by allied pilots. Armament included two fuselage-mounted
  13-mm MG 131 machine guns and four wing-mounted MG 151/20E 20mm cannons. The Anton
  could also be loaded with unguided rockets and bombs.


  The A-8 version of the Fw 190 entered production in February 1944, and it was powered
  by a BMW 801 D-2 radial engine. In addition to excellent low- and medium-altitude
  performance, the engine was also very rugged. Along with the F-8 version, it also
  had thicker armor around the engine. The engine also received the C3 injection system
  that provided an emergency boost of 1,980 PS in short durations."
