  "The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 (Russian: \u041C\u0438\u043A\u043E\u044F\

  \ NATO reporting name: Foxbat) is a supersonic interceptor and reconnaissance aircraft\
  \ that was among the fastest military aircraft to enter service. It was designed\
  \ by the Soviet Union's Mikoyan-Gurevich bureau and is one of the few combat aircraft\
  \ built primarily using stainless steel. It was the last plane designed by Mikhail\
  \ Gurevich before his retirement. The first prototype flew in 1964, and the aircraft\
  \ entered service in 1970. The MiG-25 was theoretically capable of a maximum speed\
  \ exceeding Mach 3 and a ceiling of 27 km (89,000 ft). Its high speed was problematic:\
  \ although sufficient thrust was available to reach Mach 3.2, a limit of Mach 2.83\
  \ had to be imposed as the engines tended to overspeed and overheat at higher air\
  \ speeds, possibly damaging them beyond repair. The MiG-25 features powerful radar\
  \ and four air-to-air missiles. When first seen in reconnaissance photography, the\
  \ large wings suggested an enormous and highly maneuverable fighter, at a time when\
  \ U.S. design theories were also evolving towards higher maneuverability due to\
  \ combat performance in the Vietnam War. The appearance of the MiG-25 sparked serious\
  \ concern in the West and prompted dramatic increases in performance for the McDonnell\
  \ Douglas F-15 Eagle, then under development in the late 1960s. The capabilities\
  \ of the MiG-25 were better understood by the west in 1976 when Soviet pilot Viktor\
  \ Belenko defected in a MiG-25 to the United States via Japan. It turned out that\
  \ the aircraft's weight necessitated its large wings."
