description: "The Mikoyan MiG-27 (Russian: \u041C\u0438\u043A\u043E\u044F\u043D \u041C\
  \u0438\u0413-27; NATO reporting name: Flogger-D/J) is a variable-sweep ground-attack\
  \ aircraft, originally built by the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau in the Soviet\
  \ Union and later licence-produced in India by Hindustan Aeronautics as the Bahadur\
  \ ('Valiant'). It is based on the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter aircraft, but\
  \ optimised for air-to-ground attack. Unlike the MiG-23, the MiG-27 did not have\
  \ widespread use outside Russia, as most countries opted for the Mikoyan-Gurevich\
  \ MiG-23BN and Sukhoi Su-22 instead. It remains in service only with the Kazakh\
  \ Air Forces in the ground attack role. All Russian, Indian and Ukrainian MiG-27s\
  \ have been retired."
