description:
  The BF 109 series was, along with the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the backbone of the
  Luftwaffe's fighter force. The Bf 109 first saw operational service in 1937
  during the Spanish Civil War and was still in service at the dawn of the jet
  age at the end of World War II in 1945. The final production version of the Bf
  109 was the K series or Kurfürst, introduced in late 1944, powered by the DB
  605D engine with up to 2,000 PS (1,973 HP). Though externally akin to the late
  production Bf 109G series, a large number of internal changes and aerodynamic
  improvements were incorporated that improved its effectiveness and remedied
  flaws, keeping it competitive with the latest Allied and Soviet fighters. The
  Bf 109's outstanding rate of climb was superior to many Allied adversaries
  including the P-51D Mustang, Spitfire Mk. XIV and Hawker Tempest Mk. V.
