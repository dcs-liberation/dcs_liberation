description: "The BF 109 series was, along with the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the backbone\
  \ of the Luftwaffe's fighter force. The Bf 109 first saw operational service in\
  \ 1937 during the Spanish Civil War and was still in service at the dawn of the\
  \ jet age at the end of World War II in 1945. The final production version of the\
  \ Bf 109 was the K series or Kurf\xFCrst, introduced in late 1944, powered by the\
  \ DB 605D engine with up to 2,000 PS (1,973 HP). Though externally akin to the late\
  \ production Bf 109G series, a large number of internal changes and aerodynamic\
  \ improvements were incorporated that improved its effectiveness and remedied flaws,\
  \ keeping it competitive with the latest Allied and Soviet fighters. The Bf 109's\
  \ outstanding rate of climb was superior to many Allied adversaries including the\
  \ P-51D Mustang, Spitfire Mk. XIV and Hawker Tempest Mk. V."
