description:
  The MiG-21bis is a delta wing, supersonic, fighter-interceptor jet aircraft.
  Much like the AK-47 became the everyman's rifle, the MiG-21 has been operated by
  more than 40 countries worldwide, and has enjoyed the longest production run of
  any modern jet fighter to date. The MiG-21, in all of its variants, has fought in
  wars stretching all the way from the Vietnam War in the 1960's to the modern day
  Syrian Civil War. Owing to its unique blend of versatility, ruggedness and maintainability,
  the MiG-21 remains in active service to this very day.
