description:
  "The P-47 Thunderbolt, nicknamed the Jug, served the United States Army
  Air Forces (USAAF) in World War II with distinction. In total 15,636 were built
  between 1941 and 1945. France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Mexico and
  Brazil also operated the P-47. It was armed with an impressive eight .50-caliber
  machine guns with 425 rounds per gun. In addition the Jug was armed with bombs and
  rockets and it excelled in the ground attack role. The P-47 also served in the bomber
  escort role before the introduction of the P-51 Mustang which had longer range.


  Powered by an R-2800-59 Double Wasp turbocharged radial engine, the aircraft enjoyed
  exceptional power and durability. The Jug substantial weight gave it tremendous
  dive speed acceleration but the aircraft suffered from quite low Mach limits and
  hence the aircraft was equipped with dive flaps to avoid dangerous effects of compressibility.
  The bubble canopy of the D version of the P-47 provided excellent all round visibility."
