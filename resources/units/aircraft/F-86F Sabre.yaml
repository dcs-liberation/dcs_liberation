description: "The North American F-86F Sabre was the most capable western fighter\
  \ of the early- to mid-1950s. This swept wing, single engine jet was the most important\
  \ western aircraft of the Korean War and often tangled with Russian-made MiG-15s\
  \ over the infamous \u201CMiG Alley\u201D. It was a hard struggle not only for the\
  \ Korean sky, but also between two excellent aircraft builders of the East and West.\
  \ In addition to its primary role as an air-to-air fighter, the Sabre could also\
  \ carry bombs and air-to-ground rockets to attack ground targets."
