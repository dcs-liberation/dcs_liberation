  'The British Spitfire is one of the most iconic fighter aircraft of World
  War II. Most famous for its role in the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire served as
  Britain''s primary fighter during the entirety of the war. The Spitfire combines
  graceful lines, eye-watering dogfight performance, and heavy firepower in its later
  variants.


  The Spitfire Mk IX was originally developed as a stopgap measure as a response to
  the appearance of the Focke-Wulf FW 190A.


  The Spitfire IX is powered by the Merlin 66. This engine produces its best performance
  at slightly lower altitudes than the older Merlin 61. Spitfires equipped with this
  engine were designated LF Mk IX. This was the most numerous version of the Mk IX,
  with 4,010 produced. The majority of Mk IXs of all types used the standard "c" wing,
  which would often carry two 20mm cannon and four .303in machine guns.


  The Mk IX was a significant improvement on the Mk V. It had a top speed of 409 mph
  at 28,000 feet, an increase of 40 miles per hour. Its service ceiling rose from
  36,200 feet to 43,000 feet. It could climb at 4,000 feet per minute. In July 1942,
  an early Mk IX was flown against a captured Fw 190A, and the two aircraft were discovered
  to have very similar capabilities. The RAF had its answer to the Fw 190 problem.


  The Mk IX replaced the Mk V from June 1942. It allowed the RAF to go back onto the
  offensive in occupied Europe, and resume the "circus", "ramrod" and "rodeo" raids.
  Its first combat success came on 30 July 1942, when a Spitfire Mk IX shot down a
  Fw 190. Amongst other notable achievements, the Mk IX took part in the highest altitude
  combat of the Second World War, when it intercepted a Ju 86R at 43,000 feet over
  Southampton on 12 September 1942. On 5 October 1944 Spitfire Mk IXs of 401 Squadron
  were the first allied aircraft to shoot down an Me 262 Jet. The Mk IX remained in
  service until the end of the war, even after the appearance of the Griffon powered
  Mk XIV.'
