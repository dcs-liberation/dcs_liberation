  The prototype F1M flew in April 1998, and CASA delivered the remainder between March 1999 and 15 March 2001.
  The project included a revised cockpit with colour LCDs and a Smart HUD from Sextant Avionique,
  a Sextant inertial navigation system with GPS interface; NATO-compatible Have Quick 2 secure communications;
  Mode 4 digital IFF; a defensive aids suite; and flight recorders. The radar was upgraded to Cyrano IVM standard,
