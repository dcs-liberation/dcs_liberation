description: The M30 Cargo carrier was a variant of the M12 Gun Motor Carriage (a
  US self-propelled gun), which itself was derived from the M3 Lee tank. Neither vehicle
  was extensively produced, around hundreds being manufactured. It was exclusively

  obsolete after the war and retired from service.
