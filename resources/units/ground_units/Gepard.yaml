description: The Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard ("anti-aircraft cannon tank Cheetah",
  better known as the Flakpanzer Gepard) is an all-weather-capable German self-propelled
  anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG).[1] It was developed in the 1960s and fielded in the 1970s,
  and has been upgraded several times with the latest electronics. It constituted
  a cornerstone of the air defence of the German Army (Bundeswehr) and a number of
  other NATO countries. In Germany, the Gepard was phased out in late 2010 and replaced
  by Wiesel 2 Ozelot Leichtes Flugabwehrsystem (LeFlaSys) with four FIM-92 Stinger
  or LFK NG missile launchers.
