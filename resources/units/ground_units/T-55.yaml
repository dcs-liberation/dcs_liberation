class: Tank
description: The T-54/55 series was the most-produced tank in history. Estimated production
  numbers for the series range from 86,000 to 100,000. They were replaced by the T-62,
  T-64, T-72, T-80 and T-90 tanks in the Soviet and Russian armies, but remain in
  use by up to 50 other armies worldwide, some having received sophisticated retrofitting.
  During the Cold War, Soviet tanks never directly faced their NATO adversaries in
  combat in Europe. However, the T-54/55's first appearance in the West around the
  period of the 1950s (then the beginning of the Cold War) spurred the United Kingdom
  to develop a new tank gun, the Royal Ordnance L7, and the United States to develop
  the M60 Patton.
