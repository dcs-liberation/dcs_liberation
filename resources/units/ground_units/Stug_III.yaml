class: ATGM
description: "The Sturmgesch\xFCtz III (StuG III) assault gun was Germany's most-produced\
  \ fully tracked armoured fighting vehicle during World War II, and second-most produced\
  \ German armored combat vehicle of any type after the Sd.Kfz. 251 half-track. It\
  \ was built on a slightly modified Panzer III chassis, replacing the turret with\
  \ an armored, fixed superstructure mounting a more powerful gun. Initially intended\
  \ as a mobile assault gun for direct-fire support for infantry, the StuG III was\
  \ continually modified, and much like the later Jagdpanzer vehicles, was employed\
  \ as a tank destroyer."
