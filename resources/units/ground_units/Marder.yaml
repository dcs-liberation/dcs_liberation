class: IFV
description: The Marder (German for "marten") is a German infantry fighting vehicle
  operated by the German Army as the main weapon of the Panzergrenadiere (mechanized
  infantry) from the 1970s through to the present day. Developed as part of the rebuilding
  of Germany's armoured fighting vehicle industry, the Marder has proven to be a successful
  and solid infantry fighting vehicle design. While it used to include a few unique
  features, such as a fully remote machine gun on the rear deck and gun ports on the
  sides for infantry to fire through, these features have been deleted or streamlined
  in later upgrade packages to bring it more in line with modern IFV design. Around
  2,100 were taken into service by the German Army in the early 1970s, but the vehicle
  in its German variant was not sold to any foreign militaries. As the German Army
  began to retire older vehicles, the Chilean government agreed to acquire 200 Marders;
  the government of Greece has considered the purchase of 450 retired vehicles in
  the past. Argentina uses a simplified and locally produced variant, the VCTP, and
  has a number of vehicles based on that platform constructed by Henschel and built
  by TAMSE.
