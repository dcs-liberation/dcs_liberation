description: The Tiger I was a German heavy tank of World War II that operated beginning
  in 1942 in Africa and in the Soviet Union, usually in independent heavy tank battalions.
  It was designated Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf H during development but was changed

  its first armoured fighting vehicle that mounted the 8.8 cm KwK 36 gun (derived
  from the 8.8 cm Flak 36). 1,347 were built between August 1942 and August 1944.
