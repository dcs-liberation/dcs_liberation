class: ATGM
description: The M10 tank destroyer was an American tank destroyer of World War II.
  The M10 was numerically the most important U.S. tank destroyer of World War II.
  It combined thin but sloped armor with the M4's reliable drivetrain and a reasonably
  potent anti-tank weapon mounted in an open-topped turret. Despite its obsolescence
  in the face of newer German tanks like the Panther and the introduction of more
  powerful and better-designed types as replacements, the M10 remained in service
  until the end of the war.
