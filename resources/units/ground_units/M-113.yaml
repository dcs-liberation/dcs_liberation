class: APC
description: The M113 is a fully tracked armored personnel carrier (APC) that was
  developed and produced by the Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation (FMC). The
  M113 was sent to United States Army Europe to replace the mechanized infantry's
  M59 APCs from 1961. The M113 was first used in combat in April 1962 after the United
  States provided the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) with heavy weaponry such as the
  M113, under the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) program. Eventually,
  the M113 was the most widely used armored vehicle of the U.S. Army in the Vietnam
  War and was used to break through heavy thickets in the midst of the jungle to attack
  and overrun enemy positions. About 80.000 have been build.
