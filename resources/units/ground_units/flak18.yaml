description: "The 8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41 is a German 88 mm anti-aircraft and anti-tank\
  \ artillery gun, developed in the 1930s. It was widely used by Germany throughout\
  \ World War II and is one of the most recognized German weapons of that conflict.\
  \ Development of the original model led to a wide variety of guns. Air defense units\
  \ were usually deployed with either a Kommandoger\xE4t (\"command device\") fire\
  \ control computer or a portable W\xFCrzburg radar, which were responsible for its\
  \ high level of accuracy against aircraft. The versatile carriage allowed the 8.8\
  \ cm Flak to be fired in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels; it could\
  \ be completely emplaced in only two and a half minutes."
