description: The Tiger II was the successor to the Tiger I, combining the latter's
  thick armour with the armour sloping used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed
  almost 70 tonnes, and was protected by 100 to 185 mm (3.9 to 7.3 in) of armour to
  the front.It was armed with the long barrelled 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 anti-tank cannon.
  The chassis was also the basis for the Jagdtiger turretless Jagdpanzer anti-tank
  vehicle. The Tiger II was issued to heavy tank battalions of the Army and the Waffen-SS.
  It was first used in combat by 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion during the Allied invasion
  of Normandy on 11 July 1944; on the Eastern Front, the first unit to be outfitted
  with the Tiger II was the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion, which by 1 September 1944
  listed 25 Tiger IIs operational.
