description: 'The M2 Bradley, or Bradley IFV, is an American infantry fighting vehicle
  that is a member of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle family. It is manufactured by BAE
  Systems Land & Armaments, which was formerly United Defense. The Bradley is designed
  for reconnaissance and to transport a squad of infantry, providing them protection
  from small arms fire, while also providing firepower to both suppress and eliminate
  most threats to friendly infantry. It is designed to be highly maneuverable and
  to be fast enough to keep up with heavy armor during an advance. The M2 holds a
  crew of three: a commander, a gunner and a driver, as well as six fully equipped
  soldiers. In the year 2000 the total cost of the program was $5,664,100,000 for
  1602 units, giving an average unit cost of $3,166,000. If you want to know more
  than you ever wanted about the Bradley, watch the film ''The Pentagon Wars'', its
  great!'
