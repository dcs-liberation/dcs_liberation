description: The Daimler Armoured Car was a successful British armoured car design
  of the Second World War that continued in service into the 1950s. It was designed
  for armed reconnaissance and liaison purposes. During the postwar era, it doubled
  as an internal security vehicle in a number of countries. Former British Daimler
  armoured cars were exported to various Commonwealth of Nations member states throughout
  the 1950s and 1960s. In 2012, some were still being operated by the Qatari Army.
