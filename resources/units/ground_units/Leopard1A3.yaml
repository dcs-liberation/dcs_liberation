class: Tank
description: The Leopard (or Leopard 1) is a main battle tank designed and produced
  by Porsche in West Germany that first entered service in 1965. Developed in an era
  when HEAT warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value,
  the Leopard focused on firepower in the form of the German-built version of the
  British L7 105-mm gun, and improved cross-country performance that was unmatched
  by other designs of the era. The Leopard quickly became a standard of many European
  militaries, and eventually served as the main battle tank in over a dozen countries
  worldwide, with West Germany, Italy and the Netherlands being the largest operators
  until their retirement. Currently, the largest operators are Greece, with 520 vehicles,
  Turkey, with 397 vehicles and Brazil with 378 vehicles.
