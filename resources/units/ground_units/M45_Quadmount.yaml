description: The M45 Quadmount (nicknamed the "meat chopper" and "Krautmower" for
  its high rate of fire) was a weapon mounting consisting of four of the "HB", or
  "heavy barrel" .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns mounted in pairs on each side
  of an open, electrically powered turret. It was developed by the W. L. Maxson Corporation
  to replace the earlier M33 twin mount (also from Maxson). Although designed as an
  anti-aircraft weapon, it was also used against ground targets. Introduced in 1943
  during World War II, it remained in US service as late as the Vietnam War.
