description: The Bofors 40 mm gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun, is
  an anti-aircraft autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer
  AB Bofors. It was one of the most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during
  World War II, used by most of the western Allies as well as some captured systems
  being used by the Axis powers. A small number of these weapons remain in service
  to this day, and saw action as late as the Persian Gulf War.
