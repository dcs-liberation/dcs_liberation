class: Tank
description: The Panther is a German medium tank deployed during World War II on the
  Eastern and Western Fronts in Europe from mid-1943 to the war's end in 1945. The
  Panther was intended to counter the Soviet T-34 and to replace the Panzer III and
  Panzer IV. Nevertheless, it served alongside the Panzer IV and the heavier Tiger
  I until the end of the war. It is considered one of the best tanks of World War
  II for its excellent firepower and protection, although its reliability was less
  impressive.
