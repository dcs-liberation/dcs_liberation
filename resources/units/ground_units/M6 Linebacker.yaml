class: SHORAD
description: The M6 Linebacker short-range air defense system was developed by Boeing
  to meet the US Army requirements. The new vehicle was intended to counter the threat
  posed by low-flying aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles
  to forward armored formations. Initial production Linebackers entered service with
  the US Army in 1997. A total of 99 Bradley Linebackers were ordered, however in
  2006 these were phased-out of service. The M6 is an all-weather system, capable
  of operating in day/night and all weather conditions. It is based on the M2 Bradley
  IFV and is equipped with a quadruple launcher with FIM-92 Stinger short-range surface-to-air
  missiles instead of the TOW ATGW.
