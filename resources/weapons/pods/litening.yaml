name: AN/AAQ-28 LITENING
type: TGP
year: 1999
# A bit of a hack, but fixes the common case where the Hornet cheek station is
# empty because no TGP is available. For the Viper this will have no effect
# because missiles can't be put on that station, but for the Viper an empty
# pylon is the correct replacement for a TGP anyway (the jammer goes on the
# other fuselage station, HTS isn't a good replacement, and we don't have
# LANTIRN for the Viper).
#
# For the A-10 an empty pylon is also fine.
fallback: AIM-120C
