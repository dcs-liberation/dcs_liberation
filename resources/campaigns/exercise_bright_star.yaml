description:
  <p>For over 4 decades, the United States and Egypt have run a series of
  biannual joint military exercises called Bright Star. Over the years, the
  number of participating countries has grown substantially. Exercise Bright
  Star 2025 boasts 8 participant nations and 14 observer nations. The United
  States and a portion of the exercise coalition will play the part of a
  fictional hostile nation dubbed Orangeland, staging a mock invasion against
  Cairo. Israel, having for the first time accepted the invitation to observe,
  is hosting the aggressor faction of the exercise coalition at its
  airfields.</p>
