description: <p>For over 4 decades, the United States and Egypt have run a series of biannual joint military exercises called Bright Star. Over the years, the number of participating countries has grown substantially. Exercise Bright Star 2025 boasts 8 participant nations and 14 observer nations. The United States and a portion of the exercise coalition will play the part of a fictional hostile nation dubbed Orangeland, staging a mock invasion against Cairo. Israel, having for the first time accepted the invitation to observe, is hosting the aggressor faction of the exercise coalition at its airfields.</p>
