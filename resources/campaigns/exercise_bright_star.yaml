description:
    <p>For over four decades, the United States and Egypt have conducted a series 
    of biannual joint military exercises known as Bright Star. As the 
    geopolitical landscape has transformed, so too has the scope and scale of 
    Exercise Bright Star. The exercise has grown over the years to incorporate 
    a wide array of international participants. The 2025 iteration of 
    Exercise Bright Star features eight participating nations alongside 
    fourteen observer nations.</p><p>
    For the 2025 exercises, the United States, along with a select contingent 
    from the exercise coalition, will take on the role of a hypothetical 
    adversarial nation, dubbed Orangeland. This scenario is designed to 
    simulate a mock invasion against Cairo, and presents a valuable 
    opportunity for participating nations to refine their joint operational 
    capabilities and improve logistical and tactical interoperability</p><p>
    A historic addition to Exercise Bright Star 2025 is the participation of 
    Israel as an observer nation. This marks a significant milestone, given 
    the complex historical relations in the region, and symbolises a step 
    forward in regional collaboration and military diplomacy. Israel's role, 
    hosting the aggressor faction of the exercise coalition at its airfields, 
    not only demonstrates the broadening scope of the exercise but also highlights 
    the value of fostering an environment of mutual cooperation and shared 
    security objectives.</p>
