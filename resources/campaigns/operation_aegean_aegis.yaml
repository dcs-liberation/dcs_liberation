description:
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This fictional campaign was designed for the Apache
  and Harrier. It requires manual flight planning. While enemy aircraft are present
  at airfields, there will be no enemy flights as their aircraft are grounded.</p>
  <p>
  In a sudden and alarming escalation of tensions in Cyprus, the Anatolian Order,
  a North Cypriot insurgent faction, has carried out a bold night-time assault on
  three crucial airfields in the Republic of Cyprus; Paphos, Akrotiri, and Larnaca.
  The insurgents, equipped with stolen surplus Turkish military hardware, used
  chemical weapons in their attack, forcing the evacuation of all three airfields.
  Notably, the capture of Akrotiri, a British Overseas Territory hosting a Royal
  Air Force base, has drawn significant international attention and concern.</p>
  <p>
  The EU has strongly condemned this unprovoked attack against one of its member
  states. Turkey, despite its historical connections with North Cyprus, has also
  denounced the Anatolian Order's actions and is investigating how its aircraft,
  ground vehicles, and weaponry held in storage ended up in insurgent hands.</p>
  <p>
  Amidst the crisis, a lone US Navy LHA, strategically positioned in the Aegean Sea,
  is preparing a response to the crisis. Its mission is to deploy Apache helicopters
  to neutralise the hastily erected air defenses around the captured airfields, before
  Harrier jumpjets neutralise the Anatolian Order's aircraft. These aircraft, a
  selection of mothballed Turkish F-4s and helicopters, are currently grounded due to
  lack of suitable fuel and spare parts. It is imperative that they are dealt with
  swiftly before ground troops are air-lifted in to reclaim the airfields.</p>
  <p>
  The operation's final phase involves targeting North Cyprus's only airport at Ercan.
  The plan is to bomb its runway, preventing any further airborne reinforcements by the
  insurgents. However, due to the air defenses established along the northern edge of
  the Green Line (the UN-patrolled demilitarised zone) there are strict advisories against
  overflying North Cyprus unless absolutely necessary, to minimise the risk of losses.
