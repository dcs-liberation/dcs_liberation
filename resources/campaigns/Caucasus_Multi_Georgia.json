  "description": "<p>This is Part 1 of the Caucasus Multi-Part Campaign. This is the invasion of Georgia starting from the southwest (Batumi) and ending in both Gudauta and Tiblisi. This is a straightforward campaign that is smaller and simpler than most.  However, it acts great as either a stand alone campaign for beginners, or as a lead into the Caucasus Multi-Part Russia campaign.</p>",
