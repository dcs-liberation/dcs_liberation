description:
  <p>United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) observers stationed in
  Georgia to monitor the ceasefire between Georgia and Abkhazia have been cut
  off from friendly forces by Russian troops backing the separatist state. The
  UNOMIG HQ at Sukhumi has been taken, and a small contingent of observers and
  troops at the Zugdidi Sector HQ will have to make a run for the coast,
  supported by offshore US naval aircraft. The contingent is aware that their
  best shot at survival is to swiftly retake Sukhumi before Russian forces have
  a chance to dig in, so that friendly ground forces can land and reinforce
  them.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Ground unit purchase will not be available
  past Turn 0 until Sukhumi is retaken, so it is imperative you reach Sukhumi
  with at least one surviving ground unit to capture it. Two Hueys are available
  at Zugdidi for some close air support. The player can either play the first
  leg of the scenario as an evacuation with a couple of light vehicles (e.g.
  Humvees) set on breakthrough (modifying waypoints in the mission editor so
  they are not charging head-on into enemy ground forces is suggested), or
  purchase heavier ground units if they wish to experience a more traditional
  frontline ground war. Once Sukhumi has been captured, squadrons based in
  Incirlik Turkey can be ferried in via the "From Incirlik" off-map spawn
  point.</p>
