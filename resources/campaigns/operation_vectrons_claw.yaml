description:
  <p><strong>Background</strong>  - The United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) has been actively monitoring the ceasefire agreement between Georgia and its breakaway region of Abkhazia. Recent developments have escalated tensions in the area, leading to a precarious situation for UN observers and affiliated personnel.
  </p><p><strong>Current Situation</strong>  - UNOMIG observers, along with a contingent of international troops, have found themselves isolated due to the intervention of Russian forces supporting the separatist ambitions of Abkhazia. The UNOMIG headquarters located in Sukhumi has fallen into enemy hands. A smaller group based at the Zugdidi Sector Headquarters now faces the daunting task of navigating to safety with the aid of offshore naval air support.
  </p><p><strong>Objective</strong>  - The immediate goal is to orchestrate a strategic withdrawal of UN forces to the coastline, leveraging support from US naval aircraft positioned offshore. The critical mission objective is the rapid recapture of Sukhumi. This action is essential to enable the landing of friendly ground forces and the ferrying in of land-based sqwuadrons from Incirlik.
  </p><p><strong>Operational Constraints</strong>  - It is crucial to note that reinforcement of ground units will not be possible until Sukhumi is successfully recaptured. This recapture can either be performed using existing UN personnel and ground vehicles, or via heliborne assault troop insertion.
  </p><p><strong>Assets & Support</strong>  - Available assets include two Huey helicopters for close air support. Commanders may opt to initiate the operation with light vehicles, such as Humvees, employing breakthrough tactics to avoid direct confrontations with enemy forces. Alternatively, the use of heavier ground units is an option for commanders seeking a more conventional combat engagement. Upon the recapture of Sukhumi, additional squadrons from Incirlik, Turkey, will become operational.
  </p><p><strong>Secondary Objective</strong>  - Consider prioritising the capture of the Batumi airfield, located to the south, for its strategic value as a forward operating base. Commanders should be aware of the inherent risks, as the airfield is relatively small and lacks air defence systems, posing a significant threat to any stationed aircraft.</p>
