description:
  <p>While enroute to the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield, the USS
  Theodore Roosevelt and its carrier strike group are engufled by an electrical
  vortex and transported through time and space to the English channel on the
  morning of the Normandy Landings - June 6th 1944. Seeking to reduce the cost
  in lives to the Allied Forces about to storm the beaches, the captain of the
  Roosevelt has elected to provide air support for the
  landings.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This campaign has a custom faction that
  combines modern US naval forces with WW2 Allied forces. To play it as
  intended, you should carefully ration your use of modern aircraft and not
  replenish them if shot down (as you cannot get new Tomcats and Hornets in
  1944). You can also choose to play it as a purely WW2 campaign by switching to
  one of the WW2 Ally factions.</p>
