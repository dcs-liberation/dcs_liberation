description:
  <p>In the face of mounting sanctions against their nuclear program, Iran has
  barred all shipping from transiting the Strait of Hormuz. Three days ago, the
  Iranian Vice-President ordered a series of missile attacks on commercial
  vessels entering the Gulf of Oman through the highly strategic chokepoint,
  sinking a container ship and damaging two oil tankers. Operation Noisy Cricket
  is the American response to this threat to regional stability. The objective
  is to render inoperative Iran's array of coastal anti-ship missile sites, as
  well as disable the airfields from which maritime strike aircraft could be
  launched.</p><p>While officially intended only to deter any further attempts
  to disrupt the flow of maritime traffic and and protect the interests of the
  global economy, The USAF will also leverage the resultant degradation in
  Iranian air defences to launch a deep strike from airfields in the UAE in an
  attempt to take out Iran's last combat-worthy F-14 Tomcats, currently
  stationed at Kerman. At the same time, a carrier-based Marine detachment will
  be inserted via helicopter to conduct an unscheduled inspection of the Bushehr
  Nuclear Power Plant, in order to verify Iran's compliance with international
  nuclear agreements and gather evidence of any ongoing nuclear weapons
  development.</p>
