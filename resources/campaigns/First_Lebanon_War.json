On June 3, the attempted assassination of Israeli Ambassador, Shlomo Argov by gunmen with ties to the PLO have finally pushed the Israelis to action.</p><p>Recommended Starting Budget:</p><p>$1500m for recommended factions, $$2000m for modern scenarios</p><p>Income Multiplier:</p><p>Blue: 1.0x</p><p>Red: 0.7x-1.0x</p>",
