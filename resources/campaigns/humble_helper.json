  "description": "<p>In this scenario, you start in Israel in an high intensity conflict with Syria, backed by a Russian Expeditiary Force. Your goal is to take the heavily fortified city of Damascus, as fast as you can. The longer you wait, the more resources the enemy can pump into the defense of the city or even might try to take chunks of Israel. ATTENTION: CAMPAIGN INVERTING IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!!! Feedback: @Headiii in the DCSLiberation Discord</p>",
