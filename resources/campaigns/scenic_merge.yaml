description: <p>A merge of the two Scenic Route campaigns. <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Iran has declared war on all US forces in the Gulf resulting in all local allies withdrawing their support for American troops. A carrier group, aided by USAF units stationed on the south bank must pacify Iran's coastal defences and push inland. Iran has assembled the full might of its air and ground divisions to defend their heartland.</p>
