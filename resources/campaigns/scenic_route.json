    "description": "<p>A lightweight naval campaign involving a US Navy carrier group pushing across the coast of Iran. <strong>Note that the ground units purchased on turn zero must sustain you until you've taken the first hostile FOB. The starting point does not have a factory to simulate a Marine Expeditionary Force deploying from the carrier group.</strong></p><p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Iran has declared war on all US forces in the Gulf, resulting in all local allies withdrawing their support for American troops. A lone carrier group must pacify the southern coast of Iran and hold out until backup can arrive, lest the US and her interests be ejected from the region permanently.</p>",
