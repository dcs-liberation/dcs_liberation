  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This campaign was designed for helicopters.</p><p>
  Set against the rugged and windswept backdrop of the Falkland Islands,
  this fictional campaign scenario unfolds with a dramatic dawn sneak attack
  on RAF Mount Pleasant Airbase. Orchestrated by a Russia-backed private
  military company, the deadly offensive with helicopter gunships and ground troops
  has left the airbase's runways in ruins and its defences obliterated. This brutal
  incursion resulted in significant casualties among the RAF personnel, with many
  killed or wounded in the unexpected onslaught. The carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and
  its task force are on their way to evacuate the survivors and retake Mount Pleasant.
  However, they are eight days away at full steam.</p><p>
  Amidst this chaos, a beacon of hope emerges in the heart of the Falklands. At Port
  Stanley, a small detachment of US military personnel, including helicopter pilots
  and armor units, find themselves inadvertently thrust into the fray. Originally at
  Port Stanley for some R&R following a training exercise, these soldiers now face
  an unexpected and urgent call to action. Their mission is daunting but clear - to
  prevent the capture of Port Stanley and liberate East Falkland from the clutches
  of the PMC forces.</p><p>
  This small group must strategically push the PMC forces back through the treacherous
  valley lying between Wickham Heights and the Onion Ranges, an area ominously known
  as No Man's Land. Their plan involves a daring assault to destroy the enemy's
  helicopter gunships stationed at San Carlos FOB. Following this, they aim to force
  the PMC ground forces into a strategic retreat southward, along the 1.6 mile wide
  isthmus into Lafonia. This calculated offensive is designed to create a defensible
  position at Goose Green on the narrow isthmus, which can be held against a numerically
  superior force until the arrival of Big Lizzie.</p>
