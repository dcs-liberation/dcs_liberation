description: <p>Welcome to Vegas Nerve, an asymmetrical Red Flag Exercise scenario. You are starting off in control of the two Tonopah airports, and will push south from there. For the duration of this exercise, Creech AFB has been cleared of all fixed wing aircraft and will function as a FARP for rotor ops. OPFOR has a substantial resource advantage and an extensive IADS. Reducing that resource advantage while degrading their IADS will be vital to a successful completion of this exercise. Good luck, Commander.</p>
