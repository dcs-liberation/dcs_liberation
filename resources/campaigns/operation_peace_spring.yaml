name: Syria - Operation Peace Spring
theater: Syria
authors: Starfire
recommended_player_faction: Bluefor Modern
recommended_enemy_faction: Iraq 1991
description: <p>This is a semi-fictional what-if scenario for Operation Peace Spring, during which Turkish forces that crossed into Syria on an offensive against Kurdish militias were emboldened by early successes to continue pushing further southward. Attempts to broker a ceasefire have failed. Members of Operation Inherent Resolve have gathered at Ramat David Airbase in Israel to launch a counter-offensive.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The default faction is set as Iraq 1991 in order to provide an opponent with a wider variety of units. While Turkey 2005 would be the historical faction (and has preset squadrons included), they only have two jets available (F-4 and F-16).</p>
