description:
  <p>This is a semi-fictional what-if scenario for Operation Peace Spring,
  during which Turkish forces that crossed into Syria on an offensive against
  Kurdish militias were emboldened by early successes to continue pushing
  further southward. Attempts to broker a ceasefire have failed. Members of
  Operation Inherent Resolve have gathered at Ramat David Airbase in Israel to
  launch a counter-offensive.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The default faction
  is set as Iraq 1991 in order to provide an opponent with a wider variety of
  units. While Turkey 2005 would be the historical faction (and has preset
  squadrons included), they only have two jets available (F-4 and F-16).</p>
