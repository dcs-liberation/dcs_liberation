description: <p>A lightweight naval campaign involving a US Navy carrier group pushing across the coast of Iran. <strong>This is a purely naval campaign, meaning you will need to use the Air Assault mission type with transports to take the first FOB. Ensure you soften it up enough first!</strong></p><p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Iran has declared war on all US forces in the Gulf resulting in all local allies withdrawing their support for American troops. A lone carrier group must pacify the southern coast of Iran and hold out until backup can arrive lest the US and her interests be ejected from the region permanently.</p>
