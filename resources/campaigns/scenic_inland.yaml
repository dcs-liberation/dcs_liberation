description: <p>A continuation of Scenic Route. A NATO coalition pushes inland along a protracted axis of advance. Built with helicopters/FOB-based gameplay in mind. <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> With Iran's coastal defences pacified and their forces pushed inland, a beleaguered US Navy is reinforced by a NATO coalition task force. The going will not be easy however; Iran has assembled the full might of its armoured and mechanized divisions alongside rotary support to defend their heartland. The conflict intensifies.</p>
