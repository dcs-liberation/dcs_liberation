description:
  <p>Operation Velvet Thunder is a high-intensity training exercise designed to
  prepare fresh troops for the challenges they will face in Vietnam. The dense
  jungle and rugged terrain of the Mariana Islands will provide a realistic
  backdrop, allowing our forces to hone essential skills in jungle warfare,
  unconventional tactics, and counterinsurgency operations. There are multiple
  checkpoints scattered across the area of operations that will have to be
  captured by Air Assault. Due to the limited size and availability of LZs, it
  is vital to pay close attention to where you designate troop drop off zones.
  </p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This campaign is intended to be played with the
  A-4 Skyhawk and OV-10a aircraft mods active. The C-101CC has also been included
  as a stand-in for the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly in order to provide a CAS platform
  of roughly equivalent combat capability. This campaign will be updated to use
  Heatblur's F-4 Phantom II once it is in early access.</p>
