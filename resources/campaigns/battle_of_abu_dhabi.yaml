  # Blue CPs:
  # The default faction is Iran, but the F-14B is given higher precedence so
  # that it is used if the faction is something US. The F-14A will be used if
  # the player picks some Iran faction that for some reason has carriers.

  # Bandar Abbas:
  # This is the main transit hub for blue, so it contains all the logistics-type
  # squadrons: airlift, refueling, and AEW&C. It also contains an air-to-air
  # squadron for self defense, a bomber squadron, and some air-to-ground
  # squadrons.
  #
  # Due to its location, this will be the primary airbase for the initial phase
  # of the campaign.

  # Red CPs:
  # Squadrons are designed to work with either UAE 2015 (the default) or a
  # typical Russian-sourced aircraft faction.

  # Al Dhafra AFB:
  # This CP has factories attached and is the largest red base, so is the main
  # logistics hub, with an airlift, AEW&C, and refueling squadron.
  #
  # For combat this base operates two pure air-to-air squadrons, two pure air-
  # to-ground, and four multi-role. Al Minhad is closest to the front so CAS
  # squadrons are placed there, but will retreat here after capture.
