  "description": "<p>This is based on the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and the Greek defense of the island. You must make sure to keep your beachhead at all costs, otherwise reclaiming it will be tricky. It is recommended to reduce the per-turn income rate for both factions in this scenario due to the large oil depots both sides have - setting it to around 15-20% is probably reasonable.</p>",
