description:
  <p>An Argentinean extremist group has contracted the Sons of Warvan (SoW), an
  unusually well-equipped PMC with close ties to the Russian government, to
  construct a beryllium bomb at the secret Omega 13 production facility in
  Ushaia for use in its ongoing conflict with Chile. United States military
  forces have established a foothold at San Julian. While the SoW are distracted
  up north, it is up to the Marines to launch an assault upon Ushaia from an LHA
  in order to disable the bomb production facility. Fortunately, Ushaia is
  lightly defended as the SoW are trying to avoid unwanted attention.</p>
