description:
  <p>An Argentinean extremist group has contract the Sons of Warvan (SoW), an
  unusually well-equipped PMC with close ties to the Russian Goverment, to
  construct a beryllium bomb at Ushaia for use in its ongoing conflict with
  Chile. United States military forces have established a foothold at San
  Julian. However, the limited facilities means most land-based aircraft have to
  remain at Mount Pleasant in the Falklands until more airfields are in friendly
  hands. While the SoW are distracted up north, it is up to the Marines on an
  LHA to launch an assault upon Ushaia from the sea in order to disable the bomb
  production facility.</p>
