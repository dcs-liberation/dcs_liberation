description:
  <p>In this mission, it is just as important to kill the economy generating
  buildings, as it is to kill the enemy ground units. The enemy will be able to
  spend a lot of money replacing units if you do not target the
  buildings.</p><p>Each airbase has one or more factories. Each airbase has only
  three ammo targets.</p>
