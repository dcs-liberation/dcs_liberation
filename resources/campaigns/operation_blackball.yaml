name: Syria - Operation Blackball
theater: Syria
authors: Fuzzle
description: <p>A lightweight fictional showcase of Cyprus for the Syria terrain. A US Navy force must deploy from a carrier group to push through the island. <strong>This is a purely naval campaign, meaning you will need to use the Air Assault mission type with transports to take the first FOB. Ensure you soften it up enough first!</strong></p><p><strong>Backstory:</strong> The world is at war. With the help of her eastern allies Russia has taken the Suez Canal and deployed a large naval force to the Mediterranean, trapping a US carrier group near the Turkish-Syrian border. Now they must break out by taking Cyprus back.</p>
