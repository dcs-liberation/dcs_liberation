description:
  <p>A naval campaign where a US carrier group must fight through Argentina and
  Chile to repel Chinese invaders. <strong>This is a purely naval campaign,
  meaning you will need to use the Air Assault mission type with transports to
  take the first FOB. Ensure you soften it up enough
  first!</strong></p><p><strong>Backstory:</strong> As war explodes around the
  Pacific Rim, a Chinese battle group breaks through the blockade and makes for
  South America, looking to establish bases within striking distance of the US'
  southern allies. To avoid follow-on PLAN forces should they break through the
  fighting to the west, a USN battle group is dispatched from the east coast of
  the US to clear the Chinese forces from the continent and crush their carrier
  group.</p>
