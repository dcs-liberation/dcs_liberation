<b>You are clear for takeoff</b>

<p>
  Some player flights may be delayed to start. For such flights, it will not be
  possible to enter the cockpit for a delayed flight until its mission start
  time, shown in the flight information window.
</p>

<p>
  To reduce delays, schedule packages with player flights with an earlier TOT.
  Note that if some flights within the package will take a long time to reach the
  target, a player flight may still be delayed.
</p>

<p>
  To avoid delays entirely, use the "Never delay player flights" option in the
  mission generation settings. Note that this will <strong>not</strong> adjust
  the timing of your mission; this option only allows you to wait in the
  cockpit.
