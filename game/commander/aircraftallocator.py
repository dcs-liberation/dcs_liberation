        Searches for aircraft capable of performing the given mission within the
        maximum allowed range. If insufficient aircraft are available for the
        mission, None is returned.

        Airfields are searched ordered nearest to farthest from the target and
        searched twice. The first search looks for aircraft which prefer the
        mission type, and the second search looks for any aircraft which are
        capable of the mission type. For example, an F-14 from a nearby carrier
        will be preferred for the CAP of an airfield that has only F-16s, but if
        the carrier has only F/A-18s the F-16s will be used for CAP instead.

        Note that aircraft *will* be removed from the global inventory on
        success. This is to ensure that the same aircraft are not matched twice
        on subsequent calls. If the found aircraft are not used, the caller is
        responsible for returning them to the inventory.
