    If the function has save compatibility for the current major version, there is no
    change in behavior.

    If the function has save compatibility for a *different* (future or past) major
    version, DeprecatedSaveCompatError will be raised during startup. Since a break in
    save compatibility is the definition of a major version break, there's no need to
    keep around old save compat code; it only serves to mask initialization bugs.

    Args:
        major: The major version for which the decorated function has save
        compatibility.

    Returns:
        The decorated function or method.

    Raises:
        DeprecatedSaveCompatError: The decorated function has save compat code for
        another version of liberation, and that code (and the decorator declaring it)
        should be removed from this branch.
