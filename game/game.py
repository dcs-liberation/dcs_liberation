        Some actions (like transit network assembly) will happen both here and in

        base captures when processing the transfers that occurred last turn, but we also

        (such as to account for a cheat base capture) so that orders are only placed

        processing happens in `pass_turn` (despite the name, it's called both for
        skipping the turn and ending the turn after combat).

        Special care needs to be taken here because initialization can occur more than
        once per turn. A number of events can require re-initializing a turn:

        * Cheat capture. Bases changing hands invalidates many missions in both ATOs,
          purchase orders, threat zones, transit networks, etc. Practically speaking,
          after a base capture the turn needs to be treated as fully new. The game might
          even be over after a capture.
        * Cheat front line position. CAS missions are no longer in the correct location,
          and the ground planner may also need changes.
        * Selling/buying units at TGOs. Selling a TGO might leave missions in the ATO
          with invalid targets. Buying a new SAM (or even replacing some units in a SAM)
          potentially changes the threat zone and may alter mission priorities and
          flight planning.

        Most of the work is delegated to initialize_turn_for, which handles the
        coalition-specific turn initialization. In some cases only one coalition will be
        (re-) initialized. This is the case when buying or selling TGO units, since we
        don't want to force the player to redo all their planning just because they
        repaired a SAM, but should replan opfor when that happens. On the other hand,
        base captures are significant enough (and likely enough to be the first thing
        the player does in a turn) that we replan blue as well. Front lines are less
        impactful but also likely to be early, so they also cause a blue replan.
