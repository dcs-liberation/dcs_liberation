#: not work correctly.

#: There is no verification that the campaign author updated their campaign correctly

#: Version history:
#:
#: Version 0
#: * Unknown compatibility.
#:
#: Version 1
#: * Compatible with Liberation 2.5.
#:
#: Version 2
#: * Front line endpoints now define convoy origin/destination waypoints. They should be
#:   placed on or near roads.
#: * Factories (Workshop_A) define factory objectives. Only control points with
#:   factories will be able to recruit ground units, so they should exist in sufficient
#:   number and be protected by IADS.
#:
#: Version 3
#: * Bulker Handy Winds define shipping lanes. They should be placed in port areas that
#:   are navigable by ships and have a route to another port area. DCS ships *will not*
#:   avoid driving into islands, so ensure that their waypoints plot a navigable route.
