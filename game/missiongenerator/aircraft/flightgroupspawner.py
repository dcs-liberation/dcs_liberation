        StartType with a delay. Note that delays are actually created during waypoint
        generation.

        Aircraft that are *not* WaitingForStart will be spawned in their current state.
        We cannot spawn aircraft mid-taxi, so when the simulated state is near the end
        of a long taxi period the aircraft will be spawned in their parking spot. This
        could lead to problems but that's what loiter points are for. The other pre-
        flight states have the same problem but are much shorter and more easily covered
        by the loiter time. Player flights that are spawned near the end of their cold
        start have the biggest problem but players are able to cut corners to make up
        for lost time.

        Aircraft that are already in the air will be spawned at their estimated
        location, speed, and altitude based on their flight plan.
