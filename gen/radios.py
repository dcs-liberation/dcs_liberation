    There's some room for improvement here. We could prefer to allocate

    available to narrower radios like the AN/ARC-186(V). In practice there are
    probably plenty of channels, so we can deal with that later if we need to.

    We could also allocate using a larger increment, returning to smaller
    increments each time the range is exhausted. This would help with the
    previous problem, as the AN/ARC-186(V) would still have plenty of 25 kHz
    increment channels left after the AN/ARC-210 moved on to the higher
