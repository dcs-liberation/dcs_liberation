"""Air Tasking Orders.

The classes of the Air Tasking Order (ATO) define all of the missions that have
been planned, and which aircraft have been assigned to them. Each planned
mission, or "package" is composed of individual flights. The package may contain
dissimilar aircraft performing different roles, but all for the same goal. For
example, the package to strike an enemy airfield may contain an escort flight,
a SEAD flight, and the strike aircraft themselves. CAP packages may contain only
the single CAP flight.
