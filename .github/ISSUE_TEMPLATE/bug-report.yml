        Select all DCS Liberation versions in which you have observed this bug.
        You do not need to test all of them, but the information is useful if
        you have it.


        If you do not see your version listed here you are on an old release
        that is not supported, and the bug may already be fixed in a newer
        release. Check that the bug still exists in a newer release before
        filing.


        If the bug was found in a development build, select "Development build"
        and provide a link to the build in the field below.
      options:
        - 6.0.0

      label: Save game and other files
      description: >
        Attach any files needed to reproduce the bug here. **A save game is
        required.** We typically cannot help without a save game (the
        `.liberation` file found in `%USERPROFILE%/Saved
        Games/DCS/Liberation/Saves`), so most bugs filed without saved games
        will be closed without investigation.


        Other useful files to include are:


        The Liberation log file. The log file is located at `<Liberation install
        directory>/logs/liberation.log`. The log often includes data about
        non-fatal errors that could be the root cause of the problem.


        The `liberation_nextturn.miz` or a track file. This should always be
        included for bugs where the mission was generated incorrectly or where
        the in-game AI is misbehaving.


        The `state.json` file for the most recently completed turn, located at
        `<Liberation install directory>/state.json`. This file is essential for
        investigating any issues with end-of-turn results processing. **If you
        include this file, also include `last_turn.liberation`.**


        You can attach files to the bug by dragging and dropping the file into
        this text box. GitHub will not allow uploads of all file types, so
        attach a zip of the files if needed.
