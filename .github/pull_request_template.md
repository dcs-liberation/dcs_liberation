Pull requests should be made against the `develop` branch. Any backports
necessary will be handled by the development team.

New features and bug fixes are usually worth mentioning in the changelog.
Exceptions are fixes for bugs that never shipped (were only present in a canary
build), and changes with no intended user observable behavior, such as a
refactor. If you're comfortable writing the note yourself, add it to
`changelog.md` in the root of the project in the section for the upcoming
release.
