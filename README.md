## Special Thanks

First, a big thanks to shdwp, for starting the original DCS Liberation project. 

Then, DCS Liberation uses [pydcs](http://github.com/pydcs/dcs) for mission generation, and nothing would be possible without this.
It also uses the popular [Mist](https://github.com/mrSkortch/MissionScriptingTools) lua framework for mission scripting.

Excellent lua scripts DCS Liberation uses as plugins:

* For the JTAC feature, DCS Liberation embeds Ciribob's JTAC Autolase [script](https://github.com/ciribob/DCS-JTACAutoLaze).
* Walder's [Skynet-IADS](https://github.com/walder/Skynet-IADS) is used for Integrated Air Defense System.

Please also show some support to these projects !
